It's a simple character generator for my tabletop RPG system.

My system has close resemblance to the SPECIAL system (Fallout 2) :-) but still there are differences. The generator is flexible and is quick to configure for any similar set of rules.

Used libraries: [jQuery](http://jquery.com), [LESS](http://www.lesscss.org).

Text is in Russian, but code should be obvious.

### To-Do list:
* Generating first-level characters
* Traits (maybe)
* Gear
